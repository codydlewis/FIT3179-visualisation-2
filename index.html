                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The visualisation <a class="vis-link" href="#vis-time-day">Number of crashes by day of week and
                            hour of day</a>
                        shows the relationship between the day of the week and the hour of the day with respect to the
                        number of crashes
                        which occur.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        You can clearly see that there are two 'groups' of rows in the heat map; the weekdays and the
                        weekends. The weekends differ from the weekdays most notably from 7 am to 6pm.
                        The weekends don't have crashes occuring as early as on weekdays and they stop occuring as late
                        in the day as on
                        weekdays. More interestingly, the weekends have crashes distributed around a single centre at
                        about 12 pm (midday),
                        whereas the weekdays have two peaks at 8 am and 5 pm. This is likely due to the lack of 'peak hour' on weekends.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Furthermore, the density of crashes on weekends is lower than that of weekdays as can be seen by
                        how the colours for
                        the weekdays are a darker shade of blue (higher on the scale) as compared to the weekends
                        colours.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="text-heading">TGIF (and Saturday)</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        On most days, crashes tend to lessen by 8 pm (after the peak hour rush). On Sunday to Thursday
                        nights (i.e., early Monday to Friday mornings), the number of crashes which occured between 12
                        am and 1 am is about 100. But on Friday and Saturday night (i.e., early Satuday and Sunday
                        morning), these numbers are doubled to about 200.

                        The visualisation <a class="vis-link" href="#alcohol">Comparison of the number of crashes at alcohol time</a> shows how the number of crashes changes throughout the week in comparing crashes within the Road Crash Information System Definition of Alcohol Times. These times are: Monday to Thursday 00:00-06:00 hours & 18:00-2359 hours, Friday
                        00:00-06:00 hours & 16:00-23:59 hours, Saturday 00:00-08:00 hours & 14:00-23:59 hours, and Sunday 00:00-10:00 hours & 16:00-23:59 hours.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The visualisation clearly shows how the number of crashes occuring during this time increases after Thursday and over the weekend, and then lowers again for Monday and the start of the work-week.

                        The visualisation <a class="vis-link" href="#year-lga">Number of crashes over time for each LGA</a> has two parts. The first, top, part is the map which shows a choropleth map of all Local Government Areas in Victoria for a selected year. You can use the slider below the entire visualisation to transition to different years which can show how the number of crashes has evolved in each LGA over the years.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The second part is a line graph which nitially shows the number of crashes for all of Victoria over the entire time
                        period of July 2015 to June 2020. However, the magic of this visualisation comes with interactivity with the choropleth map. You can click on one of the LGAs in the choropleth map to 'select' that LGA. The line graph then updates to show the number of crashes over time for that LGA only.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Please note, the year slider intentionally does not affect the line graph. It is only meant to show the change in the choropleth map, while the line graph is to show the context of crashes over the entire time period.

                        This dataset classifies each road crash as one of three severity ratings: "Fatal accident", "Serious injury accident", and "Other injury accident".

                        The visualisation <a class="vis-link" href="#injury-lga">Severity of crashes in top 10 LGAs</a> compares the ten LGAs in Victoria with the most number of crashes. As can be seen in the bar chart, Melbourne has the most crashes of all LGAs in Victoria. Interestingly, Melbourne does not have the most Fatal accidents; Geelong has the most Fatal crashes of these LGAs. This is likely due to the increased speed and efficiency with which Ambulances are able to attend road crash scenes. This is; however, speculation and is not known for certain.

                        The visualisation <a class="vis-link" href="#vis6">Number of crashes over time in LGA speed zones</a> shows the number of crashes which occur over time for each speed zone.

                        It shows that the most crashes occur in 60 km/h speed zones. This is logical since there are many more 60 km/h speed zones both in terms of number of speed zones and in terms of total length of road in Victoria at this speed than other speed zones. It is also logical since most high-traffic areas (where crashes are more likely to occur) are in urban residential areas where the speed limit must be 60 km/h.

                        A potential future improvement of this visualisation would be to normalise the data in terms of the number of speed zones so that it would show the relative number of crashes at each speed zones so we could determine if one particular speed zone is more prone to crashes than others.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        "Road geometries" refers to the shape of the road. These shapes have two broad categories: intersection, or not intersection. But the intersection group can be divided further into the various shapes seen around Victorian roads.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The visualisation <a class="vis-link" href="#vis5">Road geometries at road crash sites by LGA</a> shows the number of crashes for the top 10 LGAs in terms of the road geometries at the crash site. The drop down menu in the bottom left allows you to pick viewing of a particular LGA.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        As you can see, the "Not at intersection" road geometry has the most crashes followed closely by "T intersection" and "Cross intersection". These are like the speed zone classes where the data is likely showing the number of these geometries present around the state rather than the relative number of crashes. Hence, it is unlikely we are able to conclude that one particular geometry is more prone to crashes than any other. At least, no unless we find access to data containing the number of these geometries around Victoria to normalise the data.

                        It shows that most of the crashes are clustered around major Victorian cities such as Melbourne, Geelong, Ballarat, Shepparton, etc. In fact, the dot map shows the major roads in Victoria also since you can see 'lines' or chains of dots across the map.
